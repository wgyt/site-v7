# Hosting Lightning

Lightning is pretty easy to host, with it taking a few steps:

1. [Configuring a database](database.md) and [Plugins](plugins.md)
2. [Configuring Lightning](configuration.md)
3. [Legacy Migrations (optional)](legacy-migrations.md)
4. [Hosting with Deno](deno.md) or [Hosting with Docker](docker.md)
